// package — one of six, selected by npm from `os`/`cpu`/`libc`.
//
// It is not on the hook path. `aval init` bakes `current_exe()` — the native
// binary this spawns, not this file — into `.git/hooks`, so the ~30ms of node
// start-up below is paid once during `prepare` and never again on a commit.
// See npm/README.md.

// Parameterised by binary name rather than copied per binary. Everything below
// — pnpm's non-hoisting, the libc fallback, spawn-versus-exists, signal exit
// codes — was learned once and is worth exactly one copy; a second wrapper that
// duplicated it would be a second place for those lessons to rot.
